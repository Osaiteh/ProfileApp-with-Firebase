            * https://ssl.gstatic.com is required only on Android and is needed for TalkBack to function properly
            * Disables use of inline scripts in order to mitigate risk of XSS vulnerabilities. To change this:
                * Enable inline JS: add 'unsafe-inline' to default-src

        <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
        <p>I'm Ogbebor Glory Osaiteh. Welcome to my personal website. This website would express my passion for
            Technology I have embraced technology because, without any doubt, technology makes things easier and faster.
            Creating applications to that effect is exactly what my passion is.</p>
        <p>I also believe anything that's worth
            doing, is worth doing well. I'm still on a journey of becoming who I really envision myself to be. This
            single webpage would describe where I'm coming from and where I'm going.</p>

            <p class="card-extra-title">SheCanWithICT</p>
            <p>This program was organised in 2017 and it lasted for 6 months. The program was organised by Women Technology Empowerment Centre (WTEC) in collaboration with Intel West Africa, University of Lagos(Unilag),
                MainOne, BudgIT, Goethe Institut, Andela, WikiLovesWomen, AshaProject, WISE Nigeria, WorldPulse, Exclusive Brands Africa(EBA), Irede Foundation ans Slingshot Technologies.
                Even though the main aim was to teach women to incoporate ICT in their businesses, career and network, it was not limited to that.</p>
            <p>This was where I first learnt about the great possibilities of technology, where my passion for
                technology began and this was also where I met my first model, Mrs. Yetunde Johnson, the MD of Slingshot
                technologies.</p>

            <p class="card-extra-title">Code Lagos</p>
            <p>I attended CodeLagos in 2018. I learnt the basics of frontend web development using HTML, CSS and
                JavaScript.</p>
            <p>I designed a basic restaurant website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>

            <p>The ALC 4.0 was launched on the 15th of may 2019. The Program was organised by Andela Learning
                Community(AlC) in
                partnership with Google and Pluralsight. It's an online learning program with occassional
                physical meet-ups. The Programme was devided into 3 phases. For each phase, we had one meet-up, one test
                requirement
                and one project at least. At the end of the day, I grew from a Novice to an Expert, according to
                Pluralsight standards.</p>
                <p>Here's a post I made on Linkedin that contains my Pluralsight Score:</p>

            <p class="card-extra-title">Git and Github</p>
            <p>While creating an application, I've had to use git and github to manage my project.</p>

        <div class="card-extras">
            <p class="card-extra-title">Communication and Teamwork</p>
            <p>Learning with ALC has helped me learn Communication and Team work. A few times, we were given projects with
                people who aren't in our immediate surrounding. Sometimes, our team would involve people we could see
                physically and othertimes, it involved people from other countries. Getting to work with such people has
                developed my skills of team work and communication.</p>

        <h3>MY PRESENT PROJECTS</h3>
        <div class="card-extras">
            <p>Presently, I'm creating an application to explore Gooogle's Cloud Firestore. This application would be an
                e-commerce application for a particular type of product.</p>

        <div class="card-extras">
            <p class="card-extra-title">Flutter</p>
            <p>I also picked up an interest in Flutter. Right now, I'm learning how to use flutter to create
                native-looking applications. On the 14th of December, I attended a Flutter event. The event was
                organized by GDG Lagos and Flutter Lagos.</p>

        <div class="card-extras">
            <p class="card-extra-title">UI/UX</p>
            <p>I think creating a beautiful application is as important as creating a functional application. I have great
                interest in UI/UX because I've used some apps in the past where I thought it could be better if something
                was done a bit differently to aid better interaction with the application.</p>
